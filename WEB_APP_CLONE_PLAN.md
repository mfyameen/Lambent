# Lambent Web App Clone - Development Plan

## Project Overview

This plan outlines the development of a web-based clone of the Lambent iOS photography tutorial application. The web app will maintain the core educational functionality while leveraging modern web technologies for broader accessibility.

## Core Functionality Analysis

Based on the iOS app analysis, the essential features to replicate are:

### 1. Main Navigation
- **Home Screen**: Grid/list of 6 photography sections (Overview, Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO, Focal Length, Modes)
- **Tutorial Navigation**: Page control with forward/back navigation between sections
- **Segment Control**: Intro/Demo/Practice tabs for each section (except Overview and Modes)

### 2. Content Display
- **Static Content**: Text-based tutorials and instructions
- **Interactive Demos**: Image sliders showing photography concept effects
- **Practice Exercises**: Guided activities for each photography concept
- **Visual Feedback**: Camera sensor visualization and parameter display

### 3. Core Interactive Elements
- **Slider Controls**: Adjusting photography parameters (aperture, shutter speed, ISO, focal length)
- **Image Transitions**: Dynamic image changes based on slider values
- **Responsive UI**: Adapting to different screen sizes

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework
**React with TypeScript** (Recommended)
- Component-based architecture matches the iOS app's view structure
- Strong TypeScript support for maintainable code
- Excellent ecosystem for image handling and animations
- Easy deployment options

**Alternative**: Vue.js or vanilla JavaScript with modern build tools

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid styling with responsive design
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **React Slider**: Interactive slider components

### State Management
- **React Context + useReducer**: For simple state management
- **Zustand**: Lightweight alternative for more complex state needs

### Backend & Data
- **Static JSON files**: Replace Firebase with local JSON for content
- **CDN/Static hosting**: For images and assets
- **Optional**: Firebase Web SDK if real-time features are needed

### Build & Deployment
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Static site hosting with CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment

## Data Migration Strategy

### Content Migration
1. **Extract Firebase Data**: Export tutorial content from Firebase Realtime Database
2. **Convert to JSON**: Structure data as static JSON files
3. **Image Assets**: Download and organize all tutorial images
4. **Content Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "sections": ["Overview", "Aperture", "Shutter Speed", "ISO", "Focal Length", "Modes"],
     "tutorials": {
       "aperture": {
         "title": "Aperture",
         "description": "...",
         "introduction": "...",
         "exercises": "...",
         "demo": {
           "images": ["fountain2.8", "fountain11", "fountain22"],
           "values": ["f/2.8", "f/11", "f/22"],
           "instructions": "..."
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
